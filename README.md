# Motion-Mend
Orthopedic biotechnology project---a novel method for automated gait analysis through physics and ML integrated with inertial sensors. Allows for personalized support and all sorts of musculo-skeletal recovery attachments. Very fun :3
>Uses: Python (Jupyter Notebook), C++, ESP32 Microcontroller, MPU6050 IMU, and a bunchhhhhhhhh of other stuff.
First draft--->My first attempt at the software end of this project. Will be uploading hardware schematics and second draft soon!!!
